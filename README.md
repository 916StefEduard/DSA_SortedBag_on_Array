# Data_Structures_And_Algorithms_Final_Project

For my last homework for the college course Data Structures and Algorithms I had to implement at a C++ version for A Sorted Bag, 
which has the values attached on a binary search tree.The keys itself is also in a Linked List on the array.
The core operations for the data structure are implemented from scratch and I whole bunch of extended tests are 
also included in the project.
